# Roo Code Custom Rules

1.  **Thinking Process**:
    - Before writing code, break down the user's request into the smallest possible actionable steps.
    - If a task involves editing more than 2 files or 50 lines of logic, BREAK IT DOWN into separate steps.

2.  **Task Management**:
    - Updates to `todo_progress.md` must be granular.
    - Never mark a task as "Done" until it is tested or verified.

3.  **Code Quality**:
    - Prefer small, focused commits/edits over massive changes.
    - Always verify the "Import" paths after moving files.

4.  **Language**:
    - Communicate in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).
